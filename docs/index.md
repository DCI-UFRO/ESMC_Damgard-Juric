# Enhancing Secure Multi-Party Computation with Damgård-Jurik and NIZK

Privacy preserving secure multi party computation protocols are known to face scalability and efficiency challenges in environments where participants hold distinct attributes of the same records (vertical partitioning) or controls a subset of complete records (horizontal partitioning), as in cross-institutional health data analysis or federated IoT analytics, mostly because of communication overhead and the need to address adaptability to large scale or heterogeneous settings. We present a secure sum protocol based on the 
Damgård-Jurik cryptosystem, implemented and evaluated within an experimental setup that considers both vertical and horizontal partitioning. The proposed protocol exploits its additive homomorphic properties to enable efficient aggregation with a single encryption 
round per party, hence significantly reducing computational and communication costs, while ensuring privacy and integrity via encryption and Non-Interactive Zero-Knowledge Proofs (NIZK). Furthermore, the practical feasibility of this protocol is reinforced by proof-of-concept and performance evaluation, demonstrating its effectiveness and efficiency in handling large datasets.
