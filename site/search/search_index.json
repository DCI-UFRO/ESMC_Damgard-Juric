We present a secure sum protocol based on the  Damg\u00e5rd-Jurik cryptosystem, implemented and evaluated within an experimental setup that considers both vertical and horizontal partitioning. The proposed protocol exploits its additive homomorphic properties to enable efficient aggregation with a single encryption  round per party, hence significantly reducing computational and communication costs, while ensuring privacy and integrity via encryption and Non-Interactive Zero-Knowledge Proofs (NIZK). Furthermore, the practical feasibility of this protocol is reinforced by proof-of-concept and performance evaluation, demonstrating its effectiveness and efficiency in handling large datasets.</p>"},{"location":"#protocolo","title":"Protocolo","text":"<p>protocol description</p>"},{"location":"#ejecucion","title":"Ejecuci\u00f3n","text":"<p>excecution example</p>"},{"location":"#requisitos","title":"Requisitos","text":"<p>software requirement</p>"}]}
